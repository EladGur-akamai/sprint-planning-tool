# Feature: Multi teams support

**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Proposed
**Created:** 2025-7-12

## Description
Add a support to add teams, and chose a team
Each team should have all the existing capacility and should be able to manage the sprints and everything by its own 
without effecting other teams.

All the existing data including the team members, sprints and everything should belong to the default team
(create it as a start) named 'Elad Team'.

Add the ability to add and edit teams including their name, adding a logo to each team (if no logo uploaded use a default one)
and add team members to every team.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All existing functionality stil works perfectly under the 'Elad Team'
- User is able to create a new team, upload it a logo, create and assign to it team members
- User is able to select a team and view it's sprints and everything according to his choise

## Technical Considerations
- make it cool, with the ability to chose the team from a drop down or something that shows the logo for each and the chsen one
