**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Proposed
**Created:** 2025-12-8

## Description
I would like the program manager in my group to create the sprints for all teams,
then the teams will have unified sprints between them (same sprint dates and names).

To make his work easier, allow him to chose the sprint duration in weeks,
Then create for him auto sprints for the current quarter with some naming convention like 2025 Q4 Sprint 1 .
Allow him to extend or modify some sprints as needed (for example if there a holiday or something).

To make it readable for each team and generally show the sprint for the current quarter only and allow to view historic sprints as well.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All existing functionality still works
- Elad sprint and data doesnt delete from production
- The sprint planning tab still present the current sprint and allow to chose a year, quorter and a sprint, by default auto chose the current year, quarter and sprint

## Technical Considerations
- Don't delete the use the existing sprints for example for Elad Team and use them as a base
- Allow me to test locally before deploying to production
